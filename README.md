# CoreMessenger
A simple messenger system for WPF, UWP and Xamarin. .NET Standard supported.

This project comes from MvvmCross.Messenger and now it can be used in all the WPF, UWP and Xamarin projects without MvvmCross. The original inspiration for this code was XPlatUtils from JonathonPeppers - https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/XPlatUtils
